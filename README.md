# Titanic: did gender increased chances to survive?

## Summary
The idea of this analizes is to confirm if women had more chance of surviving than man in the Titanic accident.

## Design
I started with pie charts but after first feedback I fugured that it was hard to see from the chart the percentages. So I changed it to be horizontal bars. After second feedback I added the legends, colors and hovers and turned it into vertical bars.

## Feedback
##### 1- Pie chart
It's hard to see from the chart the percentages of Perished and Survived.
**Action**: changed it to horizontal bars

##### 2- Vertical Bars
Hard to distinguish the Perished from the Survived only based on the color of the bars.
Also people said that the vertical orientation was worse to _feel_ the sizes. 
**Action**: added legend, colors, hover animation, changed to vertical bars.
